'''
Two random integer arrays/lists have been given as ARR1 and ARR2 of size N and M respectively. Both the arrays/lists contain numbers from 0 to 9(i.e. single digit integer is present at every index). The idea here is to represent each array/list as an integer in itself of digits N and M.
You need to find the sum of both the input arrays/list treating them as two integers and put the result in another array/list i.e. output array/list will also contain only single digit at every index.

Note:
The sizes N and M can be different. 

Output array/list(of all 0s) has been provided as a function argument. Its size will always be one more than the size of the bigger array/list. Place 0 at the 0th index if there is no carry. 

Sample Input 1:
1
3
6 2 4
3
7 5 6

Sample Output 1:
1 3 8 0

Sample Input 2:
2
3
8 5 2
2
1 3
4
9 7 6 1
3
4 5 9

Sample Output 2:
0 8 6 5
1 0 2 2 0
